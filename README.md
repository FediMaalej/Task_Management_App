Certainly! Let's design a comprehensive project that covers various aspects of the Angular learning path roadmap. This project will involve creating a Task Management application with advanced features. It will help you apply your knowledge of Angular fundamentals, forms, routing, services, RxJS, and more.

### Project: Advanced Task Manager

#### Project Description:

Build a Task Manager application that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks. This project will cover both front-end and back-end aspects, emphasizing Angular features and best practices.

#### Features:

1. **Authentication:**
   - Implement user authentication to allow users to sign up, log in, and log out.

2. **Task Management:**
   - Create, read, update, and delete tasks.
   - Display a list of tasks with details (title, description, due date, status).
   - Implement task filtering based on status (completed, pending).

3. **Task Details:**
   - Allow users to click on a task to view its details.
   - Display the task details, including the ability to edit or delete the task.

4. **Create Task:**
   - Implement a form to add new tasks.
   - Validate the form to ensure required fields are filled, and the due date is in the future.

5. **Edit Task:**
   - Allow users to edit existing tasks.
   - Use a separate form for editing tasks with pre-filled values.

6. **Delete Task:**
   - Provide an option to delete tasks.
   - Implement a confirmation modal before deleting a task.

7. **Task Status and Styling:**
   - Show task status using different styles (e.g., color-coded based on status).
   - Change the status of a task (e.g., mark a task as completed).

8. **Routing:**
   - Implement routing to navigate between the task list, task details, and task creation/editing.

9. **Authentication Guards:**
   - Implement route guards to protect routes that require authentication.

10. **Observables and RxJS:**
    - Use RxJS for handling asynchronous operations, such as fetching and updating tasks.

11. **Angular Services:**
    - Create services to manage the state of tasks and handle CRUD operations.
    - Use services to handle user authentication.

12. **Forms and Reactive Forms:**
    - Utilize reactive forms for creating and editing tasks.
    - Implement form validation and error handling.

13. **Middleware and API Integration:**
    - Create a Node.js and Express back-end to serve as the API for task management.
    - Use Angular services to interact with the API for CRUD operations.

14. **Error Handling:**
    - Implement error handling for API requests and display meaningful error messages to users.

15. **User Interface and Styling:**
    - Use Angular Material for UI components and styling.
    - Customize the theme to match the visual design of the application.

16. **Testing:**
    - Write unit tests for Angular components, services, and forms.
    - Explore end-to-end testing for critical user flows.

17. **Documentation:**
    - Document the project's structure, setup instructions, and important concepts.

### Learning Goals:

- Reinforce Angular fundamentals and best practices.
- Apply reactive programming with RxJS in a real-world application.
- Gain experience in building a full-stack application with Angular on the front end and Node.js/Express on the back end.
- Practice authentication and authorization concepts.
- Learn how to integrate and customize Angular Material components.
- Explore testing methodologies for Angular applications.

Feel free to adapt and extend the project based on your interests and the specific Angular concepts you want to emphasize. Good luck with your project, and enjoy the learning process!
