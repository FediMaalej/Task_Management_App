## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Provide a brief introduction to the Advanced Task Manager project, its purpose, and the technologies used.

## 2. Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>

Describe the overall structure and architecture of the project. Explain how the front-end and back-end components interact.

## 3. Features <a name="features"></a>

### Authentication <a name="authentication"></a>

- **Sign Up, Log In, Log Out:**
  - Description: Users can register, log in, and log out of the application.
  - Implementation: Use Angular services for authentication. Provide forms for sign-up and login.

### Task Management <a name="task-management"></a>

- **CRUD Operations:**
  - Description: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks.
  - Implementation: Utilize Angular services for task operations. Implement forms for task creation and editing.

- **Task List:**
  - Description: Display a list of tasks with details (title, description, due date, status).
  - Implementation: Use Angular Material components for the task list.

- **Task Filtering:**
  - Description: Users can filter tasks based on status (completed, pending).
  - Implementation: Implement a filter mechanism using Angular services.

### Task Details <a name="task-details"></a>

- **View Task Details:**
  - Description: Allow users to click on a task to view its details.
  - Implementation: Implement routing for task details.

- **Edit or Delete Task:**
  - Description: Display the task details, including the ability to edit or delete the task.
  - Implementation: Use separate forms for editing tasks with pre-filled values. Implement a confirmation modal before deleting a task.

### Create Task <a name="create-task"></a>

- **Task Creation Form:**
  - Description: Implement a form to add new tasks.
  - Implementation: Utilize reactive forms for creating tasks. Validate the form to ensure required fields are filled, and the due date is in the future.

### Edit Task <a name="edit-task"></a>

- **Task Editing Form:**
  - Description: Allow users to edit existing tasks.
  - Implementation: Use a separate form for editing tasks with pre-filled values.

### Delete Task <a name="delete-task"></a>

- **Task Deletion:**
  - Description: Provide an option to delete tasks.
  - Implementation: Implement a confirmation modal before deleting a task.

### Task Status and Styling <a name="task-status-and-styling"></a>

- **Task Status Styling:**
  - Description: Show task status using different styles (e.g., color-coded based on status).
  - Implementation: Use Angular Material or custom styling for visual representation.

- **Change Task Status:**
  - Description: Change the status of a task (e.g., mark a task as completed).
  - Implementation: Provide a mechanism to update task status through Angular services.

### Routing <a name="routing"></a>

- **Navigation:**
  - Description: Implement routing to navigate between the task list, task details, and task creation/editing.
  - Implementation: Utilize Angular Router for navigation.

### Authentication Guards <a name="authentication-guards"></a>

- **Route Protection:**
  - Description: Implement route guards to protect routes that require authentication.
  - Implementation: Use Angular route guards to control access.

### Observables and RxJS <a name="observables-and-rxjs"></a>

- **Handling Asynchronous Operations:**
  - Description: Use RxJS for handling asynchronous operations, such as fetching and updating tasks.
  - Implementation: Utilize observables and RxJS operators in Angular services.

### Angular Services <a name="angular-services"></a>

- **Task and Authentication Services:**
  - Description: Create services to manage the state of tasks and handle CRUD operations. Use services to handle user authentication.
  - Implementation: Use Angular services to encapsulate functionality and share data.

### Forms and Reactive Forms <a name="forms-and-reactive-forms"></a>

- **Form Creation:**
  - Description: Utilize reactive forms for creating and editing tasks.
  - Implementation: Implement form validation and error handling.

### Middleware and API Integration <a name="middleware-and-api-integration"></a>

- **Node.js and Express Backend:**
  - Description: Create a Node.js and Express back-end to serve as the API for task management.
  - Implementation: Implement middleware for handling requests and integrate with the Angular front-end using services.

### Error Handling <a name="error-handling"></a>

- **API Request Error Handling:**
  - Description: Implement error handling for API requests and display meaningful error messages to users.
